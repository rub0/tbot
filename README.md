# tbot

This is my Telegram Bot for learning scala purposes.

This bot is built with [mukel scala telegram API wrapper](https://github.com/mukel/telegrambot4s) as a base, and will use akka actors to execute commands. In the future I will implement webhooks support in top of akka-http library.

## Current Features:
	- Polling support
	- Command sending to an Actor

## Upcoming features
	- Actor response to user chat
	- Inline support

## Far features 
	- Webhooks support
